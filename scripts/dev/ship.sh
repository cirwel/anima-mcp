#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ship.sh — agent-friendly commit-and-deliver
#
# Routes changes to the right delivery path based on what they touch:
#   - Runtime code (anything under src/anima_mcp/ or pyproject.toml) →
#     feature branch + PR + auto-merge-on-green.
#   - Everything else (docs/, scripts/, tests/) → direct commit + push on
#     the current branch.
#
# The split exists because a runtime change needs a rollback artifact
# (the PR) and cross-agent visibility; docs/tests don't, and PR friction
# for every tiny edit slows the fleet down.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/dev/ship.sh "commit message"
#   ./scripts/dev/ship.sh --classify          # just print "runtime" or "other"
#
# Requirements: staged changes (git add already done), gh CLI authed.
